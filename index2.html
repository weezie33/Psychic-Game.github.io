                <p id="p2">The Psychic Game is a 1:1 game against you and the computer. The first side to reach three wins the game. You have nine attempts per round to guess the correct letter. If you guess the letter correctly you score one point for the round; however, if you do not correctly guess the letter within nine attempts the computer scores one point. After nine attempts the round is over. There can be as few as three games but as many as six. In the event that the game is tied there is a sudden death face-off of a math problem initiated by pressing the spacenbar. Which ever side correctly guess the answer first wins the tie-breaker, thus the game.</p>
                
                <p id="p3">If you are reading this that means you lost as the computer generated the answer upon you pressing the spacebar...Come on. I thought you were psychic, eh?</p>
